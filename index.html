    <p>
      I am a third year undergraduate student studying Data Science at UC San Diego with minors in Economics and Mathematics.

      Previously, I have spent internships with UCSD's Career Center as a Data Analytics intern (2024-25), UCSD's D1 Baseball team as a Baseball Analytics intern (2023-Present), 
      and as a Summer Baseball Analytics intern for Palm Springs Power Baseball (2023).

      My strengths lie at the intersection of baseball and ML, with projects in pitch classification, developing a stuff+ model, and pitch sequencing.
      I'm interested in any opportunities involving or related to baseball/data science/data analyticsâ€”so please feel free to reach out to me via my contacts page!
