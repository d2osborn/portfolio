    "description": "Engineered a Python quantile regression pipeline using gradient boosted trees to forecast expected yardage across 5 distinct percentiles (2.5th to 97.5th), quantifying strategic risk and upside of play designs. Developed an interactive <a href='https://seanmcvai.streamlit.app/' target='_blank'>Streamlit</a> dashboard integrating 2 predictive models, enabling end users to dynamically evaluate custom play designs. Presented to NFL analysts at the 2026 Football Analytics Blitz, competing against 15 teams (~70 students).",
