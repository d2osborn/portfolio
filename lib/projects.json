    "description": "Developing a Bayesian model to predict season-ahead arm-injury risk for MLB pitchers. Constructed a longitudinal dataset of 6,300 pitcher-seasons by integrating large-scale baseball and injury data sources. Applying partial pooling in a hierarchical framework to improve predictions for pitchers with limited histories.",

    "description": "Built a probabilistic defensive baseball metric that quantifies the defensive aggressiveness of outfielders from spatiotemporal tracking data using Bayesian hierarchical modeling. Developed a catch-probability model using a logistic GAM, achieving 0.162 test log-loss and a 95.7% test F1 score. Communicated technical concepts to non-technical judges using clear visuals and intuitive explanations.",
