    "description": "Formulated 'Aggression Over Expected' (AOE) by engineering a Bayesian hierarchical framework that contrasts individual player posteriors against positional counterfactuals, utilizing MCMC sampling and partial pooling to regularize estimates across limited sample sizes. Trained a Logistic Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to quantify catch probability from spatiotemporal tracking data, achieving 0.162 test log-loss and 95.7% test F1. Earned honorable mention recognition as a Top 10 finalist among 50 teams (114 students) in the 2025 SMT Data Challenge.",
