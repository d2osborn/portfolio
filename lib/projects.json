      "description": "Collaborated to develop and optimize a LightGBM regression model on 2.2M+ real estate listings, integrating geospatial, demographic, and economic data to enhance price predictions. Engineered zip code-level features by calculating proximity to universities using the haversine formula and applying geodemographic segmentation to classify homes into home type (e.g., ranch, luxury home, tiny home, etc.). Created a valuation framework comparing listed vs. predicted prices, identifying 10.5% of properties as undervalued, enabling investors to target high-potential opportunities.",

This dashboard provided a user-friendly interface for coaches and players to track their performance and showcase their metrics to any college scouts.",
